SlyBuy
====

Ever wished you could do secret Santa and it's still June? Well now you can. SlyBuy takes a fixed pre-payment from you and orders a random item from Amazon.com within a $10 margin of your payment and delivers it to you.

SlyBuy is a fun way of giving your friends or yourself a present. The only catch? You don't know what the item is until you receive it. This website guarantees loads of excitement, discovery, and amusement.

But why stop there? We figured that we'd do something useful with this concept as well. SlyBuy has a list of charities that provide us with an Amazon wish list each. Our goal is to take your generous donations and collect enough to begin sending these charities their wishes. Obviously, we pick a random item from the wishlist.
